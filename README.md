# Physician Scheduler - OR-Tools Scaffold

A constraint-based scheduling engine using Google OR-Tools (CP-SAT Solver) for generating daily physician schedules in a group practice.

## Overview

This scaffold provides the core structure for constraint-based physician scheduling with the following components:

- **Input Management**: Physician data, calendar days, and assignable roles
- **Variable Definition**: Boolean variables for (physician, day, role) assignments
- **Constraint Framework**: Placeholder functions for various scheduling constraints
- **Objective Function**: Placeholder for optimization goals
- **Output Generation**: Structured schedule export

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the scheduler:
   ```bash
   python src/scheduler.py
   ```

## TODO

This is a scaffold - the following components need to be implemented:

- [ ] Specific constraint logic in `constraints.py`
- [ ] Real objective function in `scheduler.py`
- [ ] Input validation and error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Integration with external data sources
